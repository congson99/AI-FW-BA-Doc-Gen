You are syncing project context files from Confluence into the local `project/` folder.

## Steps

1. Check whether `project/project_config.md` exists:
   - If not → stop and inform the user: "project/project_config.md not found. Run /init first."

2. Check whether `## 0. Status` in `project/project_config.md` contains a `Latest MCP connect:` line with a real timestamp (not a placeholder):
   - If not found → stop and inform the user: "MCP not connected yet. Please run /connect-mcp first."

3. Read `project/project_config.md` and scan for unfilled placeholders (pattern `<...>`) only within `## 2. Context Sync` section. Stop scanning at `## 3.`. Ignore placeholders inside code blocks (fenced with ` ``` `).
   - If any placeholders are found → stop and inform the user:
     ```
     project/project_config.md has unfilled placeholders:
       - <placeholder 1> (section: <section name>)
       - <placeholder 2> (section: <section name>)
       ...
     Please complete these sections before running /sync.
     ```

4. Read `project/project_config.md` and locate the `## 2. Context Sync` section. Parse only the entries within that section. Each entry has this format:
   ```
   - <local-file-path>
     url: <confluence-page-url>
   ```
   Stop parsing at the next `## ` heading (i.e. `## 3.`) — do not read entries from other sections.

5. For each valid entry:
   a. Fetch the Confluence page content using the provided URL.
   b. Convert the page content to clean Markdown.
   c. Write the result to the specified local file path, creating the file if it does not exist.
   d. Track success or failure per entry.

6. Report results:
```
Sync complete:

✓ project/context/project.md — fetched from <url>
✓ project/reference/<filename>.md — fetched from <url>
✗ project/context/<filename>.md — failed: <reason>

Skipped (no URL): <count> entries
```

7. After syncing, scan the following folders for **orphaned files** — `.md` files that exist locally but have no matching entry in `project/project_config.md`:
   - `project/context/`
   - `project/reference/` (top-level files only)
   - `project/reference/business-rules/principles/`
   - `project/reference/business-rules/shared-references/`
   - `project/reference/ui-behavior/principles/`
   - `project/reference/ui-behavior/shared-references/`
   - `project/reference/navigation/`
   - `project/reference/messages/`

   If orphaned files are found → ask the user:
   ```
   The following local files are not mapped in project_config.md:
     - project/reference/business-rules/old-rules.md
     - ...

   Delete these files? (yes/no)
   ```
   - **yes** → delete all listed files and confirm: `✓ Deleted <count> orphaned file(s).`
   - **no** → leave them untouched and note: `Orphaned files kept.`

   If no orphaned files are found → skip this step silently.

8. Update `project/project_config.md` with the sync timestamp:
   - Get the current date and time at the moment sync completes.
   - Check if a `## 0. Status` section already exists in the file:
     - **If it exists** → update the `Latest sync:` line in place with the new timestamp.
     - **If it does not exist** → insert the following block immediately after the `# Project Config` title line (with one blank line before the next section):
       ```
       ## 0. Status
       Latest sync: YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS
       ---
       ```
   - Use the format `YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS` for the timestamp.
